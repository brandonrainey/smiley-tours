        Hi I'm Miley I am a ninja apprentice! Former Japanese idol and voice
        actress. I've been working in the entertainment industry for over 10
        years, but my Work suddenly decreased due to corona. So just two years
        ago, I started working in Asakusa. I heard a story from a local person
        while getting to know various people in the area. Asakusa is a popular
        tourist destination, but the guides are aging and there are no young
        guides. So I decided to become a guide. 
        <br />
        <br />
        I have been doing stage shows
        for a long time, so I would like to offer a new type of tour that
        combines the skill of a guide with the skill of entertainment. My dream
        is to make guides a popular profession and increase the number of young
        guides. I hope it can help realize sustainable tourism!
